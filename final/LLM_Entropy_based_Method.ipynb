The optimal strategy in 20 question game is to ask questions that reduces the uncertainty the most and narrow downs the keyword candidates to half. This is equivalent to asking questions that minimizes conditional entropy. For guesses at each step, the optimal strategy is to guess with the word that has the highest probability conditioned on the questions so far (maximizing likelihood). This is the approach \n[introduced in Kaggle11th place solution by majimekun (link) ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/writeups/majimekun-11th-place-solution-majimekun).\nand was also used in 1st place solution.\n\n<font color='red'> At first we also included some rule-based questions as TAs mentioned Kaggle 20q comptetition and many of them have used this method. Later, TAs mentioned that only llm logits must be used. We didn't delete the rule-based questions code, but we ignored them at the evaluation phase at the end and **in evaluation we just use entropy method based on llm answer logits to semantic questions**.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Entropy Method","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If everything was ideal, the answers for every question and words was deterministically yes or no and there would be ideal questions. in that case we would just search among questions and at each step we would choose the question that answer for half of the words (weighted by their priors) were \"yes\" and for the other half were \"no\". \n\nIn practice, there is not deterministic answers and ideal questions. Here is where the beautiful concept of entropy comes in. We know that entropy is a measure of uncertainty. We have a prior probabability over words which this distribution has a entropy. The problem of choosing next question at each step is conceptually asking a question that reduces the uncertainty the most. This is exactly the ideal solution in this domain which is formulated by:\n(This is an equivalent optimization problem that its optimal solution is when question divides probabilities in half. We know that in discrete space, entropy is maximum when distribution is uniform which is when uncertainty is maximum. and when distribution gets close to deterministic, the entropy and uncertainty minimizes. We want conditional entropy of secret words contioned on questions and want to find the question that reduces entropy the most) \n$$\n\\arg\\min_{q}\\;\n\\sum_{z\\in\\{\\text{Yes},\\text{No}\\}}\np\\!\\left(q=z \\mid q_{1},\\ldots,q_{t}\\right)\\,\n\\Bigg[\n  - \\sum_{k}\n    p\\!\\left(k \\mid q_{1},\\ldots,q_{t},\\, q=z\\right)\n    \\log p\\!\\left(k \\mid q_{1},\\ldots,q_{t},\\, q=z\\right)\n\\Bigg]\n\\quad(1)\n$$\n\nwhere k represents a keyword, q represents a question, and $q_{1},\\ldots,q_{t}$ are the already asked questions (and answers). The truly “optimal” plan is a policy tree that optimises over all poaaible $(q_{1},\\ldots,q_{t})$. As it is so computationally expensive, we act more greedy and we optimize sequentially (turn-by-turn), and optimising over one question at each step by minimizing expected conditional entropy given the current history.\n\nFor this purpose, we need first a list of words and their prior probabilities which says how commonly they are used. \n\n\nWe also need a list of questions to optimize on which are discussed in later cells.
