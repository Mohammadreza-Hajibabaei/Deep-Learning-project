Reeves: This visually stunning book explores contemporary architecture through the lens of 25 influential architects and their most iconic buildings. Each architect's work is presented through beautiful photographs and insightful text, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of architecture.\n\nBoth of these books offer a unique perspective on contemporary architecture and are sure to inspire and educate anyone with an interest in the field. Let me know if you need any more recommendations! \n\n👤 What chapters do those books include?\n🤖 I'd be happy to provide more information about the chapters in each of the books I recommended, but please note that the specific chapters may vary between editions and printings, so it's always a good idea to check the table of contents in the book you're considering for the most accurate information.\n\n\"The Folio of New Architecture: Contemporary Architecture from the Pritzker Prize\" by Philip Johnson and Mark Lee is organized by the year the architects received the Pritzker Prize. Each chapter is dedicated to the work of a single architect, and includes photographs of their most significant buildings, as well as an essay by the authors that provides context and analysis. The architects featured in the book include Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster, Rem Koolhaas, and many others.\n\n\"Bold: Contemporary Architecture Explored\" by Evan M. Reeves is organized thematically, with each chapter focusing on a particular aspect of contemporary architecture, such as sustainability, innovation, and experimentation. Each chapter includes profiles of architects who have made significant contributions in that area, along with photographs and descriptions of their work. The architects featured in the book include Bjarke Ingels, Shiger\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ask(\"my name is David do you know about Newton?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-14T13:09:13.485443Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-14T13:09:13.485727Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-14T13:09:36.588465Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-14T13:09:13.485709Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-14T13:09:36.587845Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Yes, I can certainly help answer questions about Sir Isaac Newton, the famous English mathematician, physicist, and scientist who is widely recognized for his contributions to the scientific revolution.
